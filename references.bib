	abstract = {Ubiquitous smartphones have created a significant opportunity to form a low-cost wireless Citizen Sensor network and produce big data for monitoring structural integrity and safety under operational and extreme loads. Such data are particularly useful for rapid assessment of structural damage in a large urban setting after a major event such as an earthquake. This study explores the utilization of smartphone accelerometers for measuring structural vibration, from which structural health and post-event damage can be diagnosed. Widely available smartphones are tested under sinusoidal wave excitations with frequencies in the range relevant to civil engineering structures. Large-scale seismic shaking table tests, observing input ground motion and response of a structural model, are carried out to evaluate the accuracy of smartphone accelerometers under operational, white-noise and earthquake excitations of different intensity. Finally, the smartphone accelerometers are tested on a dynamically loaded bridge. The extensive experiments show satisfactory agreements between the reference and smartphone sensor measurements in both time and frequency domains, demonstrating the capability of the smartphone sensors to measure structural responses ranging from low-amplitude ambient vibration to high-amplitude seismic response. Encouraged by the results of this study, the authors are developing a citizen-engaging and data-analytics crowdsourcing platform towards a smartphone-based Citizen Sensor network for structural health monitoring and post-event damage assessment applications.},

	abstract = {Roller element bearings are a common component and crucial to most rotating machinery; their failure makes up around half of the total machine failures, each with the potential to cause extreme damage, injury and downtime. Fault detection through condition monitoring is of significant importance. This paper demonstrates bearing fault detection using widely accessible consumer audio tools. Audio measurements from a smartphone and a standard USB microphone, and vibration measurements from an accelerometer are collected during tests on an electrical induction machine exhibiting a variety of mechanical bearing anomalies. A peak finding method along with use of trained Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classify the faults. It is shown that the classification rate from both the smartphone and the USB microphone was 95 and 100{\%}, respectively, with the direct physically detected vibration results achieving only 75{\%} classification accuracy. This work opens up the opportunity of using readily affordable and accessible acoustic diagnosis and prognosis for early mechanical anomalies on rotating machines.},

	abstract = {Large magnitude earthquakes in urban environments continue to kill and injure tens to hundreds of thousands of people, inflicting lasting societal and economic disasters. Earthquake early warning (EEW) provides seconds to minutes of warning, allowing people to move to safe zones and automated slowdown and shutdown of transit and other machinery. The handful of EEW systems operating around the world use traditional seismic and geodetic networks that exist only in a few nations. Smartphones are much more prevalent than traditional networks and contain accel-erometers that can also be used to detect earthquakes. We report on the development of a new type of seismic system, MyShake, that harnesses personal/private smartphone sensors to collect data and analyze earthquakes. We show that smartphones can record magnitude 5 earthquakes at distances of 10 km or less and develop an on-phone detection capability to separate earthquakes from other everyday shakes. Our proof-of-concept system then collects earthquake data at a central site where a network detection algorithm confirms that an earthquake is under way and estimates the location and magnitude in real time. This information can then be used to issue an alert of forthcoming ground shaking. MyShake could be used to enhance EEW in regions with traditional networks and could provide the only EEW capability in regions without. In addition, the seismic waveforms recorded could be used to deliver rapid microseism maps, study impacts on buildings, and possibly image shallow earth structure and earthquake rupture kinematics.},

The approach is based on the fact that natural frequencies are sensitive indicators of structural integrity. Thus, an analysis of periodical frequency measurements can be used to monitor structural condition. Since frequency measurements can be cheaply acquired, the approach could provide an inexpensive structural assessment technique. The relationships between frequency changes and structural damage are discussed. Various methods proposed for detecting damage using natural frequencies are reviewed. Factors which could limit successful application of vibration monitoring to damage detection and structural assessment are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Circular arches subjected to in-plane loading are restrained with discrete lateral bracings to improve their out-of-plane stabilities in many cases. The arch segment between two adjacent bracings may buckle out of plane if the effective length of the arch segment is sufficiently large. During out-of-plane buckling, adjacent arch segments may provide elastic restraints which increase the out-of-plane stability of the arch segment significantly. This paper is concerned with out-of-plane elastic buckling of circular arch segments with elastic end restraints. The analytical method for deriving the out-of-plane buckling loads of circular arches with equal rotational restraints or equal warping restraints at both ends is formulated. For the convenience of structural designers, simple approximate formulas for predicting the out-of-plane buckling loads of these arches are developed by the curve-fitting method. As for circular arches with unequal rotational restraints, the approximate formula for the buckling load of the arch with equal rotational restraints is modified with a reduction factor. Comparisons with the finite-element results and the analytical solutions show that the predictions by approximate formulas are sufficiently accurate. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},
