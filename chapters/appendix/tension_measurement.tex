I measured spoke tensions using the WheelFanatyk analog tensiometer and the calibration table supplied with the instrument. The tensiometer works on the principle that the spoke under tension behaves like a guitar string, i.e. the lateral stiffness is proportional to the tension. The spoke is loaded by a linear spring with a precisely known stiffness and the displacement is measured on the opposite side as where the load is applied. The instrument is shipped with a calibration table giving the tension for a range of displacements.

A straightforward analysis of the mechanics involved, assuming that the tension remains constant and the bending stiffness is negligible, leads to the following relationship for the tension as a function of the measured displacement:
\begin{equation}
\T = a\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\right) + b
\end{equation}

The parameters $a$ and $b$ differ slightly for different spoke diameters because the preloaded spring contacts the spoke at a different point along its stroke, and thick spokes may be more affected by bending stiffness. By fitting the model above to the calibration data, I determined the following parameters for different spoke diameters:\todo{fill in remaining entries}

\hline
Spoke diameter & \bf 1.5 mm & \bf 1.7 mm & \bf 1.8 mm & \bf 2.0 mm\\
\hline
$a$ [\si{N.mm}]  & - &  423.8 & - & -\\
$b$ [\si{N}]     & - & -220.8 & - & -\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The spoke tensions reported in this thesis are found using the model above to effectively interpolate the values supplied by the manufacturer.
