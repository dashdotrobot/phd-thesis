If the spokes are tensioned beyond a critical value the circular shape of the wheel becomes unstable and the rim buckles into a non-planar shape. The post-buckling configuration is generally stable and the original shape of the wheel can be recovered by reducing the spoke tensions. Despite its implications for wheel stiffness and strength, the buckling problem has never received a rigorous treatment. Jobst Brandt alludes to buckling in his practical manual for wheelbuilding \cite{Brandt1993}:

\begin{quote}
\emph{``If the wheel becomes untrue in two large waves during stress relieving, the maximum, safe tension has been exceeded. Approach this tension carefully to avoid major rim distortions. When the wheel loses alignment from stress relieving, loosen all spokes a half turn before retruing the wheel.''}
\end{quote}

Stress relieving is the practice of laterally loading the rim (or the spokes directly) so that the spokes temporarily increase their tensions, which is presumed to relieve residual stresses in the spoke elbows and prevent fatigue failures.

Flexural-torsional buckling of the rim can be treated as a special case of buckling of an arch with an included angle of $2\pi$ and appropriate periodic boundary conditions. Timoshenko and Gere \cite{Timoshenko1961} studied the stability of arches and rings and gave a formula for the critical load for a ring with a doubly-symmetric cross-section subjected to a line load directed towards the ring's center The theory of flexural-torsional buckling of monosymmetric arches has been studied by many researchers using the virtual work approach \cite{Yoo1982,Trahair1987,Pi1992,Kang1994,Pi1995,Lim2004,Ryu2012}. The stability theory has been extended to arches with continuous \cite{Pi2002} or discrete \cite{Bradford2002} elastic supports and elastic end restraints \cite{Guo2014}.

The problem of the prestressed bicycle wheel is unique for a number of reasons. First, the buckling load is internal to the structure. Second, the spokes act both as elastic restraints resisting buckling and as prestressing elements promoting buckling. Third, the lateral, radial, tangential, and torsional restraining actions of the spokes are commonly coupled: lateral deflection at a spoke may produce a mix of those reactions on the rim section. These considerations extend to other structural systems. Large observation wheels such as the London Eye \cite{Mann2001} and the Singapore Flyer \cite{Allsop2009} resemble bicycle wheels and achieve lateral stability by bracing the rim with prestressed cables, and must be designed against flexural-torsional buckling. At the biological scale, the cellular fragmentation process which leads to platelet formation may also be driven by a flexural-torsional buckling instability of a growing ring of bundled actin fibers loaded by an elastic membrane which both promotes buckling and provides elastic restraint \cite{Stroberg2016}.


\section{Elastic stability criterion}
I showed previously (Section \ref{sec:ModeMatrix}) that the deformed shape of the wheel under external loads could be found by solving the mode matrix equation \eqref{eq:mm_Kd_f}. One form of the elastic stability criterion states that for any admissible deformation, the second variation of the total potential \eqref{eq:mm_TotPot} must be positive. Since any rim deformation must be periodic and continuous, the modes in \eqref{eq:mm_FourierDef} form a set of kinematically admissible deformations. Therefore the buckling tension is the tension at which \eqref{eq:mm_Kd_f} admits nontrivial solutions for $\gls{Fext}=\mathbf{0}$.

The spoke stiffness comprises a term proportional to the elastic stiffness $\gls{Ks}$ of the spokes and a term proportional to the spoke tension $\T$. Additionally, the rim stiffness comprises a term depending on the bending, torsion, and warping constants, and a term proportional to the net radial spoke tension per unit length, $\Tb$. In order to make the dependence on $\Tb$ explicit, the buckling criterion is written as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tc_crit}
\det{\left[\matl{\KmRim} + \matl{\KmSpk} + \Tb(\geom{\KmSpk} - \geom{\KmRim})\right]} = 0
\end{equation}

If the complete details of discrete spokes and possible radial-lateral coupling are retained, a numerical solution to \eqref{eq:Tc_crit} can be obtained by including enough modes such that the relevant length scales (e.g. the distance between spokes) are correctly approximated, and then either numerically solving the characteristic polynomial of \eqref{eq:Tc_crit}, or iteratively increasing $\Tb$ until the determinant is minimized. Under more restrictive assumptions, analytical solutions are possible, as shown in Table \ref{tab:BucklingSolutions}.

If the smeared-spokes approximation is used, the stiffness matrix $\KmRim + \gls{KmSpkSm}$ has a block diagonal form, with each block corresponding to a different mode $n$. The first two modes $n=0$ and $n=1$ are rigid-body motions of the rim and do not admit buckling. The buckling criterion then becomes

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tc_crit_smeared}
\det{\left[\matl{\mathbf{K}_{rim,n}} + \matl{\mathbf{\bar{K}}_{spk,n}} + \Tb(\geom{\mathbf{\bar{K}}_{spk,n}} - \geom{\mathbf{K}_{rim,n}})\right]} = 0
\end{equation}

In its most general form, Eqn. \eqref{eq:Tc_crit_smeared} results in a quadratic equation for $\Tb$ which can be solved to find the critical tension $\Tb_{c,n}$ for a given mode $n$. The critical buckling tension $\Tb_c$ for the wheel is the minimum $\Tb_{c,n}$ over all integer modes.

The spoke axial stiffness $\gls{Espk}\gls{As}$ is much greater than the spoke tension. Therefore, the tension components of the spoke stiffness matrix $\geom{\bar{k}_{ij}}$ can generally be neglected compared with $\matl{\bar{k}_{ij}}$, except for $\kuu$ due to the small lateral projection of the spoke vector. In this section I will neglect the tension component of all stiffness parameters except for $\geom{\kuu}$.

\subsubsection*{No radial/lateral coupling}
If the radial/lateral spoke coupling terms are neglected ($\kuv=\kuw=\kvp=\kwp=0$), the buckling criterion \eqref{eq:Tc_crit_smeared} reduces to
\begin{multline}
\label{eq:Tc_quad}
\left(\R^2\geom{\kuu}\yo - n^2\R\yo \right)\Tb^2\\
-\left[\frac{\EIl}{\R}\left(n^2 - 3n^4 \frac{\yo}{\R} + \R\geom{\kuu}\right)
       +\frac{\widetilde{\GJ}n^2}{\R}\left(n^2 - \frac{\yo}{\R}(2n^2 - 1) - \R\geom{\kuu}\right) \right.\\
       \left. +\R\kpp (n^2 - \R\geom{\kuu}) + 2\R\yo\kup n^2 - \R^2\matl{\kuu} \yo \vphantom{\frac12} \right]\Tb\\
+\left[\frac{\EIl \widetilde{\GJ} n^2}{\R^4}(n^2-1)^2
       +\EIl\left(\matl{\kuu} + 2\frac{\kup}{\R}n^2 + \frac{\kpp}{\R^2}n^4\right) \right.\\
       \left. +\widetilde{\GJ}n^2\left(\matl{\kuu} + 2\frac{\kup}{\R} + \frac{\kpp}{\R^2}\right)\right]=0
       % +\R^2(\matl{\kuu}\kpp - \kup^2)\right] = 0
\end{multline}

where $\widetilde{\GJ} = \GJ + \EIw n^2/\R^2$ is the effective torsional stiffness.

\subsubsection*{No radial/lateral coupling, bi-symmetric rim}
The quadratic term in \eqref{eq:Tc_quad} is proportional to $\yo$. If the rim cross-section is assumed to be symmetric across both the $\eo$ and $\et$ axes, then the buckling criterion \eqref{eq:Tc_quad} reduces to a linear equation for $\Tb$. Using the non-dimensional parameters defined in Section \ref{sec:Lateral}, the non-dimensionalized critical buckling tension is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tcn_lin}
\ts_{c,n} = \left(\frac{1}{n^2 - \R\geom{\kuu}}\right)
\left(\matl{\lr_{uu}}
      +\frac{\mt n^2(n^2-1)^2
             +(n^4 + \mt n^2)\lr_{\p\p}
             +2n^2(\mt + 1)\lr_{u\p} - \lr_{u\p}^2}
        {1 + \mt n^2 + \lr_{\p\p}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\mt=\widetilde{\GJ}/\EIl$ is the effective torsion stiffness ratio, including warping. The first term $(n^2 - \R\geom{\kuu})^{-1}$ reflects the fact the spokes (and therefore the direction of the applied tension at the rim) rotates under a buckling displacement. This term accounts for the difference between buckling under dead loads (e.g. gravity) and directed loads (e.g. tensioned cables). For typical wheels, $\R\geom{\kuu} \approx 1$.

\subsubsection*{No radial/lateral coupling, bi-symmetric rim, no spoke offset}
If the spokes are assumed to connect to the rim through the shear center, the lateral/torsional coupling terms vanish, i.e. $\lr_{u\p}=\lr_{\p\p}=0$. The critical buckling tension is given by \cite{Ford2016}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcn_lin_nophi}
\ts_{c,n} = \left(\frac{1}{n^2 - \R\geom{\kuu}}\right)
\left(\matl{\lr_{uu}}
      +\frac{\mt n^2(n^2-1)^2}
        {1 + \mt n^2}\right)
\end{equation}

The critical tension $\ts_{c,n}$ for a given mode depends on $n$, $\mt$, and $\matl{\lr_{uu}}$. Therefore, the critical mode $n_c$ only depends on $\mt$ and $\matl{\lr_{uu}}$. Figure \ref{fig:tc_lambda_mu} (a) shows a map of the critical buckling modes and their respective shapes ($\mt=\m$ for simplicity). Much like the related problem of the straight beam on an elastic foundation, the bicycle wheel buckling problem exhibits a length scale which depends on the ratio of beam stiffness to foundation stiffness. In an infinite beam, the wavelength of the buckling mode varies continuously with stiffness ratio. This relationship is used to estimate the elastic modulii of thin-films \cite{Chung2011}. In the bicycle wheel problem, the buckling wavelength must fit around the rim, i.e. the circumference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength. This constraint gives rise to the discrete mode transitions shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tc_lambda_mu}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includesvg{\rootdir/figs/buckling_tension/}{tc_lambda-mu}

Parameters held constant are $\m=0.38$ for (b) and $\matl{\lr_{uu}}=10$ for (c).}
\label{fig:tc_lambda_mu}
\end{figure}

The equivalent spring model described in Section \ref{sec:equiv_springs} provides some insight into Eqn. \eqref{eq:tcn_lin_nophi}. The buckling tension can be found by solving Eqn. \eqref{eq:Kn_n} such that $K_{n\geq 1} = 0$.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tcn_equiv_springs}
\Tb_{c,n} = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\frac{1}{n^2 - \R\geom{\kuu}}\right) K_n^0
\end{equation}

where $K_n^0$ is given by Eqn. \eqref{eq:Kn_n}, evaluated at zero tension. As with the lateral mode stiffness, the spoke stiffness and rim torsional stiffness play a significant role in determining the buckling tension \emph{for a given mode, $n$}.

Why, with an infinite series of potential buckling modes available, do we only observe the ubiquitous ``taco'' ($n=2$) shape? There are several possible explanations: first, it may be that wheels in common use fall into the upper left portion of Fig. \ref{fig:tc_lambda_mu}. This is especially likely for modern double-wall rims which are considerably stiffer compared with their spoke systems (low $\lr_{uu}$) than single-wall rims. As an example, a 32-hole Mavic A119 rim laced to a \SI{50}{mm} wide rim would need a spoke diameter of almost \SI{2.5}{mm} to cross the boundary into the $n=3$ region. Second, the buckling tension for such a wheel would be unreasonably high---the wheel in the previous example has a buckling tension of \SI{3.6}{kN}, or about 3.7 times the maximum recommended tension for most rims (\SI{100}{kgf}).

A third reason has to do with the sub-critical behavior. As shown in Section \ref{sec:equiv_springs}, the stiffness of each mode decreases linearly with spoke tension. At zero tension, the $n=2$ mode is always less stiff than the $n=3$ mode, etc. Even a wheel which falls in the $n=3$ region of Fig. \ref{fig:tc_lambda_mu} has $K_2<K_3$ for tensions below a significant fraction of the buckling tension. As the spoke tension is incrementally increased in such a wheel, geometric imperfections in the rim with wavelengths equal to $n=2$ will be magnified by the decreasing $K_2$ stiffness. The rim will become severely distorted long before the tension is high enough to see the $n=3$ mode appear.


\section{Finite-element buckling calculations}

I validated the theoretical predictions of Eqn. \eqref{eq:tcn_lin_nophi} against non-linear finite-element simulations implemented in ABAQUS Standard 6.14. The spokes and rim were both modeled using 2-node linear beam elements including shear flexibility. A controlled tensioning strain was applied to the spokes starting from zero strain and increasing up to \SI{150}{\percent} of the strain at which buckling was expected to occur. The rim was given a geometric imperfection in the lateral coordinate (a ``wobble'') including several modes of the form $\cos{n\gls{ang}}$. The solution was obtained by implicit integration including non-linear geometric effects. The average spoke tension was recorded at each loading step. The buckling tension was determined as the point at which the tension vs. strain curve deviated by more than \SI{2}{\percent} from linearity. Results are plotted against theory in Fig. \ref{fig:tc_lambda_mu} (b) and (c).

\begin{figure}

\includesvg{\rootdir/figs/buckling_tension/}{tension_buckling_dynamic}

\label{fig:tension_buckling_dynamic}
\end{figure}

In addition to global buckling, the wheel can exhibit local buckling if any of the spokes lose tension during deformation. The initial post-buckling behavior of the bicycle wheel under tension is stable. After bifurcation, further tensioning of the spokes deforms the rim at roughly constant or slowly rising average tension. Since the buckling load of a spoke is much smaller than the initial tension, it exerts essentially no force on the rim when buckled. Therefore, local buckling of the spokes leads to a loss of stiffness which can cause global collapse. During collapse, strain energy stored during tensioning is released and the system finds a new minimum energy configuration.

Figure \ref{fig:tension_buckling_dynamic} illustrates a dynamic finite-element simulation of a complete tensioning-detensioning cycle, implemented in ABAQUS Explicit. The spoke tensions increase uniformly until the equilibrium path bifurcates at point I. The rim follows the lower-energy path I $\rightarrow$ II by buckling and twisting out of its initial plane. As the spokes are tightened further, the rim deforms to accommodate the change in length. Although the average spoke tension remains constant, individual spokes increase or decrease their tension depending on which side of the rim they are on. At II, the spoke at the peak of each wave buckles, which reduces the overall stiffness of the structure causing it to collapse to III.

The collapse at point II may also involve a mode transition. Depending on the properties of the wheel, the lowest bifurcation mode may be $n>2$. A rim with no spokes will always buckle into the lowest mode $n=2$, however the spoke stiffness may stabilize higher modes. When spokes buckle, the stiffness drops suddenly causing the system to prefer the $n=2$ mode.


\section{Closed-form solutions for special cases}

The critical tension in Eqn. \eqref{eq:tcn_lin_nophi} is not in closed form due to the need to minimize $\ts_{c,n}$ with respect to $n$. In the following sections I will consider several special cases with approximate solutions which transform Eqn. \eqref{eq:tcn_lin_nophi} into a closed-form power law.

\subsection{Low torsional stiffness}
As the ratio $\GJ/\EIl$ tends towards zero, the mode number $n$ tends towards infinity. When the mode number is large, the buckling mode can then be found by approximating the discrete mode number $n$ with a continuous variable $\bar{n}$. We will adopt the following ansatz: (a) $\bar{n}^2 \gg 1$, and (b) $\m\bar{n}^2 \ll 1$. Under these conditions, Eqn. \eqref{eq:tcn_lin_nophi} becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcn_lomu}
\ts_{c,n} = \left(\m \bar{n}^4 + \frac{\lr_{uu}}{\bar{n}^2}\right)
\end{equation}

Minimizing \eqref{eq:tcn_lomu} with respect to $\bar{n}$ yields
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:n_lomu}
\bar{n}_c=\left(\frac{\lr_{uu}}{2\m}\right)^{1/6}
\end{equation}

Inserting \eqref{eq:n_lomu} into \eqref{eq:tcn_lomu}, we obtain the critical buckling tension, independent of mode number:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tc_lomu}
\ts_c = \left(\frac{1}{2^{2/3}} + 2^{1/3}\right)\m^{1/3}\lr_{uu}^{2/3}
\end{equation}

Substituting definitions for dimensionless quantities $\ts,\m,\lr_{uu}$, we obtain a critical buckling tension which is independent of lateral bending stiffness, $\EIl$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tc_lo_mu}
\Tb_c = 1.89 \left( \frac{\GJ}{\R} \right)^{1/3} \kuu^{2/3}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:Tc_lo_mu} further illustrates the consequences of over-designing the bending stiffness while neglecting the torsional stiffness. Since the bending and torsion stiffnesses act like equivalent springs connected in series, the stiffness---and therefore the buckling resistance---will be dominated by the smaller of the two. Thus a very wide, but very shallow rim (e.g. a ``fat-bike'' rim) will be entirely dominated by its torsional stiffness.

\subsection{Moderate torsion stiffness, stiff spoke system}
Modern rims are often constructed from hollow extruded aluminum profiles. As a result they have high torsional resistance $\GJ$ and negligible warping coefficient $\EIw$ ($\GJ \sim \EIl$ and $\EIw=0$). If the spoke stiffness is much higher than the rim stiffness, i.e. $\lr_{uu} \gg 1$, then we can make a similar argument as in the previous section. Now we will accept as an ansatz that $n^2 \gg 1$ and $\m \sim 1$. Estimating the discrete variable $n$ with a continuous analog $\bar{n}$, Eqn. \eqref{eq:tcn_lin_nophi} becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tcn_hi_k}
\ts_{c,n} = \left(\bar{n}^2 + \frac{\lr_{uu}}{\bar{n}^2}\right)
\end{equation}

Minimizing \eqref{eq:tcn_hi_k} with respect to $\bar{n}$ gives the scaling law $\bar{n}_c=(\lr_{uu})^{1/4}$. Inserting into \eqref{eq:tcn_hi_k} gives $\ts_c = 2(\lr_{uu})^{1/2}$. In terms of the net radial tension per unit length, $\Tb$, this gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tc_hi_k}
\Tb_c = 2 \left(\frac{\matl{\kuu}\EIl}{\R^2}\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}

Noting that the axial force in the rim is $\gls{Fax}=\R\Tb$, we recognize \eqref{eq:Tc_hi_k} as the critical buckling load for an infinite beam on an elastic foundation given by Hetenyi \cite{Hetenyi1946}. The rim buckles as if it were a straight beam since $\lr_{uu}$ implies that the rim radius is large compared to the characteristic length of the beam on an elastic foundation.

\subsection{All spokes lie in the plane of the wheel}

If all the spokes were laced to the same flange of the hub, the spokes will all lie in the plane of the rim, implying $\matl{\kuu}=0$. In this case, the rim will always buckle into the $n=2$ mode and Eqn. \eqref{eq:tcn_lin_nophi} simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\ts_c = \left(\frac{9\m}{1 + 4\m}\right)\left(\frac{4}{4 - \R\geom{\kuu}}\right)
\end{equation}

If the spokes meet at the center of the rim (i.e. a hub of zero diameter), then $\R\geom{\kuu}=1$ and the critical reduced tension becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tc_Hencky}
\ts_c = \frac{12\m}{1 + 4\m}
\end{equation}

This is precisely the result obtained by Hencky for the critical distributed radial load for a thin ring \cite{Timoshenko1961}. Timoshenko obtained a slightly different result which differs from Eqn. \eqref{eq:tc_Hencky} by a factor of  $3/4$, by considering dead loads which do not change direction during buckling. This case illustrates the importance of considering the geometric stiffness when deriving the spoke forces. The change in direction of the spoke force after deflection produces a small restoring force on the rim which increases the buckling load by a factor of $1/(n^2 - \R\geom{\kuu})$, or about \SI{33}{\percent} for $n=2$. Wheels with larger $\R/\gls{ls}$, and thus a larger change in spoke angle for a given lateral deflection---for example high-flange hubs or hub motors---will receive an even larger benefit from the geometric stiffness term.

\section{Experimental measurement of buckling tension}
\label{sec:K2_tension_buckling}

Several practical considerations make it difficult to reach the critical tension in a real wheel: (1) the buckling tension can be higher than the yield point of the spoke itself, (2) friction at the spoke nipple/rim interface becomes too great to overcome with a spoke wrench, and (3) the rim goes out of true laterally at around \SI{50}{\percent} of the critical tension due to imperfections in the rim.

Despite these difficulties, the mode stiffness model described in Section \ref{sec:equiv_springs} provides a method of estimating the critical buckling tension by directly measuring the stiffness of a single mode ($n=2$) as a function of spoke tension. Under the assumptions described in \ref{sec:equiv_springs}, the stiffness of the $n$th mode is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Kn_buckling}
\gls{Knlat}(\T) = \gls{KnRim} + \pi \R (\matl{\kuu} + \Tb \geom{\kuu}) - \pi n^2 \Tb
\end{equation}

The linear dependence of $\kuu$ on $\Tb$ is made explicit in Eqn. \eqref{eq:Kn_buckling} to show that $K_n$ also depends linearly on $\Tb$. By measuring the $n=2$ mode stiffness at multiple spoke tensions and then extrapolating the data to $K_2 = 0$, the critical tension $\Tb_{c,n}$ can be estimated.

\subsection{Method}

I measured $K_2$ at multiple tensions for five wheels, all constructed with the same rim and spokes but with varying distance between hub flanges\footnote{Other than the varying hub flange spacing, the properties are identical to those of the Standard Research wheel with inbound spokes, Appendix \ref{app:std_research_wheel}.}. For each wheel, I increased the spoke tension until the wheel started to buckle enough to create a significant difference between left and right spoke tensions at the anti-nodes of the rim.

\subsubsection*{Wheel construction} The rim was a Sun Ringle CR18 700C, a narrow double-wall box-section rim drilled for 36 spokes. The spokes were Wheelsmith double-butted spokes with an end diameter of 2.0 mm and 1.70 mm along the swaged section. The spokes were attached radially to the hub oriented with the spoke heads on the outside of the hub (inbound spokes). The hub was a custom-built adjustable-width hub designed by a Northeastern University capstone team advised by Jim Papadopoulos \cite{Alim2016}. I made no special effort to keep the wheel laterally or radially true to a tight tolerance, but the rim was symmetrically dished and I ensured that no individual spoke deviated in tension by more than \SI{10}{\percent} of the average tension. This eventually became impossible when the average spoke tension exceeded about \SI{50}{\percent} of the critical tension and the wheel started to distort into a taco shape.

\subsubsection*{Four-point bending test}

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption[Four-point bending test on a wheel]{Four-point bending test. \textbf{(a)} Experimental setup showing load fixture, applied load, and measurement point. \textbf{(b)} Measured lateral displacement around the rim when loaded at $\gls{ang}=-\pi$. The symmetric part of the displacement is found by subtracting $(u_l/2)\cos{\gls{ang}}$ from the measured displacement.}
\label{fig:4pt_bend_setup}
\end{figure}

Each wheel was supported on steel pins from the bottom at the 3, and 9 o'clock positions and from the top at 12 o'clock, and loaded by hanging weights at the 6 o'clock position (Fig. \ref{fig:4pt_bend_setup} (a)). The rim was oriented so that the sleeve joint and the valve hole fell midway between supports where the bending moment is minimized. Due to the symmetry of the boundary conditions, the work done against the odd modes ($n=1, 3, ...$) and even modes divisible by 4 ($n=4, 8, ...$) is identically zero. Since the hub is unsupported, the zero mode is also eliminated. Due to the rapid increase in mode stiffness with $n$, the $n=2$ mode accounts for about \SI{95}{\percent} of the strain energy, while the other \SI{5}{\percent} is spread across the remaining modes ($n=6, 10, ...$).

Figure \ref{fig:4pt_bend_setup} (b) shows the measured lateral displacement around the rim for a point load located at $\gls{ang}=-\pi$. After subtracting the rigid body rotation, the measured displacement closely matches $\cos{2\gls{ang}}$. The second mode stiffness is related to the load-displacement slope of the four-point bend test by $K_2 = 16(P/u_l)$, where $P$ is the applied load and $u_l$ is the deflection of the load point.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:K2_T_results}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includesvg{\rootdir/figs/buckling_tension/}{K2_results}
\caption[Four-point bending test results]{Four-point bending test results. \textbf{(a)} Measured mode stiffness vs. spoke tension for five different hub flange spacings. \textbf{(b)} Extrapolated mode stiffness at zero tension vs. the spoke system stiffness. The red dashed line is the rim mode stiffness, while the black dashed line is the theoretical mode stiffness from Eqn. \eqref{eq:Kn_buckling}. The bounds on all linear fits correspond to the \SI{95}{\percent} confidence interval.}
\label{fig:K2_results}
\end{figure}

As predicted by Eqn. \eqref{eq:Kn_buckling}, the measured mode stiffness decreases with applied tension (Fig. \ref{fig:K2_results} (a)). The dominant role of the spoke system in determining the wheel stiffness is apparent in the dramatic increase in stiffness from the narrowest hub (\SI{40}{mm}) to the widest hub (\SI{80}{mm}). Although the stiffness cannot be measured at zero tension due to buckling of spokes, the extrapolated zero-tension stiffness was obtained by linear regression. The zero-tension stiffness increases linearly with $\kuu$. A theoretical wheel with zero hub width and zero tension has a stiffness equal to the stiffness of the rim alone. The rim stiffness for the CR18 700C rim, \SI{71}{N/mm}, was measured using the technique described in Chapter \ref{chap:acoustic_testing} (shown as a red dashed line in Fig. \ref{fig:K2_results} (b)).

There are two notable discrepancies between the experimental results and the stiffness predicted by Eqn. \eqref{eq:Kn_buckling}. First, the material component of the spoke stiffness (proportional to $\gls{Ks}$ and independent of tension) is lower than the theoretical stiffness by about \SI{35}{\percent}. The extrapolated zero-tension stiffness should increase commensurately with $\pi R\kuu$ (black dashed line in Fig. \ref{fig:K2_results} (b)). This is possibly due to the fact that the J-bend spokes used in this study are able to deform elastically near the spoke due to the loose fit of the spoke elbow in the hub flange.

Second, the dimensionless slope $K_2$ vs. $\Tb$ is \num{-6.3+-0.25}, while the slope predicted by Eqn. \eqref{eq:Kn_buckling} is approximately $-3\pi = -9.42$. The positive difference suggests that increasing the tension causes the spokes to recover some stiffness, possibly by increasing the contact force between the spoke elbow and the edges of the hole in the hub flange. The details of the stiffness of J-bend spokes under tension is the subject of an ongoing research project.
