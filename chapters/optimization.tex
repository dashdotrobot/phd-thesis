A thesis entitled ``Reinventing the Wheel'' would not be complete without delving into the topic of optimization. For 150 years, bicycle designers and wheelbuilders have sought to improve the wheel across multiple performance metrics by changing dimensions, materials, and construction methods. This process occurred largely by trial-and-error, although in recent years component design has been greatly aided by finite-element simulation. My intent in this chapter is not to give an exhaustive optimization routine which can be followed to give the perfect wheel under any set of performance criteria, but rather to explore general trends which emerge when optimizing the wheel under a realistic set of constraints.

Optimization requires at minimum a space of tunable design parameters, an objective function defining the performance characteristic or characteristics to be optimized, and a model which predicts the performance characteristic as a function of the design parameters. Some design parameters are tunable by the wheelbuilder such as lacing pattern, spoke type, and component selection, while others are tunable by the component manufacturer such as rim cross-section shape, material, and hub flange spacing.

Keller tackled the problem of optimizing the spoke geometry in order to maximize a weighted sum of the lateral stiffness and torsional stiffness \cite{Keller2013}. With this objective function, most design parameters are trivial (e.g. spoke diameter will always optimize to the maximum possible value) so he limited the design space to the number of spokes on the left and right sides (with the total number fixed) and the in-plane spoke inclination angles ($\beta$ in this thesis). He used formulas for the lateral and torsional stiffness from Goldberg \cite{Goldberg1984} which are flawed in several respects\footnote{First, Goldberg treats the rim as a rigid body. This is a reasonable approximation for the torsional stiffness (Goldberg's formula is approximately equivalent to Equation \ref{eq:Ktan} in this thesis), however it is grossly incorrect for the lateral stiffness. Second, even if the rigid-rim approximation is used, Goldberg's formula gives a value which is approximately 50\% higher than the correct result (Equation \ref{eq:Klat_stiff_rim} in this thesis). This is apparently due to Goldberg's assumption that the rim translates as a rigid body in the lateral direction without rotation under a point load, which violates equilibrium as well as good sense.} although they trend in the correct direction. Keller's optimized wheels have different numbers of spokes on the left and right sides even for symmetrically-dished wheels, which suggests flaws in implementation\footnote{In calculating the lateral stiffness, he occasionally came across negative values which he incorrectly attributed to buckling. Goldberg's formulas do not capture elastic instability and the error is more likely due to a misinterpretation of signs.}. However, it is common to use spokes of different thicknesses on the left and right sides of an asymmetrically-dished wheel.

Svensson optimized spoke lacing patterns using a multi-objective evolutionary approach \cite{Svensson2015}. The multi-objective framework is attractive for the bicycle wheel problem because the range of sensible objective functions (compliance, peak stress, mass) have different units and do not combine in a straightforward or unique way. Rather than searching for global optimal solutions, Svensson searched for solutions lying near the Pareto-optimal front (sets of solutions in which neither objective function can be minimized without penalizing another one). The lacing pattern was represented as prescribed connections between evenly-spaced hub holes and rim holes, so all of the evolved patterns could conceivably be realized with off-the-shelf components, unlike Keller's approach. A major drawback of Svensson's approach is the simplicity of the wheel model: the rim is represented as a rigid ring, while the spokes are treated as linear springs. The loads were applied at fixed locations, so some solutions evolved highly asymmetric spoke patterns which exploited the simulator by concentrated spokes at the load points. Nevertheless, the optimizer found several conventional spoke patterns including the ubiquitous ``3-cross'' pattern, and something closely resembling the lesser-known ``crows-foot'' pattern.

Zuo, Xie, and Huang optimized the material distribution in automotive wheels using a topology optimization approach \cite{Zuo2011}. They enforced a circumferential periodicity constraint with a prescribed number of pie-slice-shaped unit cells in order to guarantee realizable solutions. Wheel performance was assessed by a 2-dimensional finite-element model under differently-weighted combined loadings including tire pressure, tangential (braking or acceleration) traction, and distributed radial pressure from the ground reaction. Several of the optimum wheels generated bear striking resemblance to existing designs. Increasing the number of unit cells caused optimal designs for differently-weighted loading scenarios to converge.

% Missing in the literature: Analytical-model-based optimization

Neither of the studies on bicycle wheels \cite{Svensson2015,Keller2013} reviewed here and no study that I am aware of incorporates the behavior of the rim into an optimization strategy. A system-level approach to optimization of the wheel must consider the realistic mechanics of the wheel, especially given the relative flexibility of the rim compared to the spoke system. Even the wheelbuilder selecting off-the-shelf components has a daunting array of choices in material and cross-section. In this chapter I will explore a highly-simplified single-parameter optimization problem parameterized by the mass fraction of the rim and elucidate the trends and scaling laws for size and mass which emerge from this highly-constrained problem.


\section{Performance criteria}

This thesis is focused on structural behavior, so the performance criteria here will be restricted to structural characteristics. Many other relevant criteria including aerodynamics, effective inertia\footnote{including translational and rotational inertia plus a no-slip condition.}, and even aesthetics could be considered, but are beyond the scope of this thesis. The performance criteria considered here are lateral stiffness, buckling tension, and radial strength.

\subsubsection*{Lateral stiffness}
The lateral stiffness is perhaps the most intuitive parameter to the average consumer. Unlike the radial stiffness, which is orders of magnitude higher than the stiffness of the tire, the lateral stiffness is small enough that it may affect the handling, stability, and ``feel'' of the wheel (although structural characteristics of the bicycle itself may be more dominant)\todo{add citations}. As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:buckling_ext_loads}, the lateral stiffness and spoke tension interact to give the maximum lateral force which can be withstood without spoke buckling.

\subsubsection*{Buckling tension}
% The spokes must be sufficiently tight to support external loads without buckling, but not so tight that the lateral stiffness is severely reduced. As a general rule of thumb, the tension should be kept below \si{50}{\percent} of the critical tension (see Section \ref{sec:buckling_lat_force}).

\section{Design space}

The design space for a bicycle wheel include parameters under the control of the wheelbuilder such as the rim type, spoke type, spoke lacing pattern, and average spoke tension. 

\subsection{Relevant design parameters}
% Describe design parameters relevant to the theory

\subsection{Narrowing the design space}
% Many design parameters are constrained, trivial, or redundant
%   Rim radius trivially optimizes to zero. Obviously needs to be constrained
%   Number of spokes and EA_s are linked
%   Hub width trivially optimizes to approx 45 degree spoke angle, usually constrained anyway
%   Rim xc radius optimizes to infinity, unless otherwise constrained
%   Rim cross-section shape could be a parameter, or constrain to either circular or fixed mu
%   n_s*EA and rim(r, t) add up to total mass

\subsection{Rim mass fraction}
% Describe rim mass fraction parameter.
% Develop expressions for t and n_s*A_s as a function of:
