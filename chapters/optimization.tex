A thesis entitled ``Reinventing the Wheel'' would not be complete without delving into the topic of optimization. For 150 years, bicycle designers and wheelbuilders have sought to improve the wheel across multiple performance metrics by changing dimensions, materials, and construction methods. This process occured largely by trial-and-error, although in recent years component design has been greatly aided by finite-element simulation. My intent in this chapter is not to give an exhaustive optimization routine which can be followed to give the perfect wheel under any set of performance criteria, but rather to explore general trends which emerge when optimizing the wheel under a realistic set of constraints.

Optimization requires at minimum a space of tunable design parameters, an objective function defining the performance characteristic or characteristics to be optimized, and a model which predicts the performance characteristic as a function of the design parameters.

\section{Design space}

\subsection{Relevant design parameters}
% Describe design parameters relevant to the theory

\subsection{Narrowing the design space}
% Many design parameters are constrained, trivial, or redundant
%   Rim radius trivially optimizes to zero. Obviously needs to be constrained
%   Number of spokes and EA_s are linked
%   Hub width trivially optimizes to approx 45 degree spoke angle, usually constrained anyway
%   Rim xc radius optimizes to infinity, unless otherwise constrained
%   Rim cross-section shape could be a parameter, or constrain to either circular or fixed mu
%   n_s*EA and rim(r, t) add up to total mass

\subsection{Rim mass fraction}
% Describe rim mass fraction parameter.
% Develop expressions for t and n_s*A_s as a function of:
%   f_rim, R, M, w/R, r/R, rho_rim/rho_spokes


\section{One-parameter optimization}
% Figure: Trends in 1-D optimization.
%   For 4 different masses: (a) K_lat vs. f_rim (b) T_c vs. f_rim (c) P_c vs f_rim
%   Compare against ABAQUS results for one mass
