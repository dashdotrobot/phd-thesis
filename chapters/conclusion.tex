% Conclusion

% Theme: balance and competition
%   Spoke and rim stiffness
%   Bending and torsion stiffness
%   Tension stiffness and buckling
%   Spoke buckling and rim buckling

% Testing, simple tools
%  A unified wheelbuilding app
%  Extending acoustic technique to complete wheel

% Open questions
%  Non-ideal spoke behavior
%  Detailed stress analysis in rim
%  Plasticity: lat. bending, rad. bending, or torsion?
