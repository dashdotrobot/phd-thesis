\section{Kinematics and strain energy}
A schematic of a typical bicycle wheel is shown in Figure \ref{fig}. The structure consists of a hub, rim, and spokes. The spokes are connected to two parallel flanges on the hub and the resulting projected bracing angle, $\alpha$,  stabilizes the rim laterally. In this way, the spokes are analogous to guy-wires. Conventional spokes are threaded into nipples set into the rim which can be tightened and loosened independently. The spokes are tensioned during construction to prevent them from buckling when the wheel carries load.

Bicycle rims today are typically constructed from thin-walled extruded sections, while rims on older bicycles were constructed from roll-formed metal strip, or sometimes solid wood. To describe forces and deformations of a wheel, we employ a local coordinate triad whose origin is at the cross section shear center, $S$. (The shear center is that unique point in a beam cross section at which a shear load causes no twist.) The basis vector $\mathbf{e}_2$ is radially inwards, the basis vector $\mathbf{e}_3$ is in the circumferential direction of increasing arc length $s$, and the lateral basis vector $\mathbf{e}_1$ completes a right-hand triad.

\subsection{Deformation of the rim}

The rim is modeled as a circular beam of constant cross-section with an axis of symmetry in the plane of the wheel. The height of the shear center $s$ relative to the centroid is $y_0$. The displacement of the rim is described in terms of the cross-section displacement $u\mathbf{e}_1 + v\mathbf{e}_2 + w\mathbf{e}_3$ in polar coordinates and rotation angle $\phi$ of the cross-section about $\mathbf{e}_3$.

The deformation of the rim is then defined by the change in curvatures and twist of its line of shear centers, and longitudinal extension of its centerline (which differs from the line of shear centers if the centroid is offset). To compute these quantities, we begin with the rotation of each cross-section, defined as a vector in terms of the cylindrical basis vectors. According to Euler-Bernoulli theory, the cross sections do not shear relative to the beam axis, so rotation is defined by slopes relative to the axis, plus a twisting rotation. Thus the cross section rotation vector is $(v + w/R) \mathbf{e}_1 + u' \mathbf{e}_2 + \phi\mathbf{e}_3$, where $()'$ denotes the derivative with respect to circumferential arc length $s$. We differentiate with respect to $s$ to get a bending and twist vector, recalling that $\et' = -\eh/R$ and $\eh' = \et/R$. The result is:

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:kappa}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{\kappa} = \kappa_1\eo + \kappa_2\et + \kappa_3\eh\\
\kappa_1 = \left( v'' + \frac{w'}{R} \right) \label{eq:kappa1}\\
\kappa_2 = \left( u'' + \frac{\phi}{R} \right) \label{eq:kappa2}\\
\kappa_3 = \left( \phi' - \frac{u'}{R} \right) \label{eq:kappa3}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

We define these three components as in-plane bending, out-of-plane bending, and twisting. For understanding rim deformation, it is worth remarking that $\phi=$ constant creates pure bending (ring eversion), while $u'=$ constant creates pure torsion (analogous to a helical spring).

To determine strain of the centroidal line, we need the displacement vector of the centroid: $\mathbf{u}_c = (u+y_0\phi)\eo + v\et + (w+y_0 (v'+w/R))\eh$. We differentiate with respect to $s$ to determine the $\eh$ component or extensional strain:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mem_strain}
\varepsilon_m = w' - \frac{v}{R} + y_0\left(v'' + \frac{w'}{R} \right)
\end{equation}

Due to the prestressing process, the reference configuration is not a state of zero stress. In addition to the tension in the spokes, the rim is under compression\cite{Sharp} (proportional to the tension in the spokes) and may also support a uniform radial bending moment about $\eo$ depending on the construction method of the rim, as well as a periodic bending moment from the separation of discrete spokes. Most modern rims are constructed from profiles permanently deformed into a circle close to its final radius, so the uniform moment can generally be neglected. We will show that the periodic moment can be neglected provided the wheel has a sufficient number of spokes compared with its in-plane bending stiffness.

The increase in strain energy in the rim in moving from the reference configuration to a deformed configuration can be decomposed into components for centroidal axial stretching, radial and lateral bending, twisting, and varied warping due to twist gradient:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_rim}
U_{rim} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{2\pi R}[EA\varepsilon_m^2 + EI_1\kappa_1^2+EI_2\kappa_2^2 + GJ\kappa_3^2 + EI_w(\kappa_3')^2]ds
\end{equation}

The warping energy $EI_w(\kappa_3')^2$ is primarily related to the bending energy in the rim sidewalls (which deform in a similar manner as the flanges of an I-beam) of the rim due to varying torsion. For a single-wall rim, the resistance to warping can account for most of the effective torsional stiffness.

\subsection{Deformation of the spoke system}

Each spoke exerts a force on the rim parallel to its direction. The connection between the rim and spoke is an ideal moment-free joint. The spoke may also exert a torque on the rim if the line of action of the spoke does not pass through the shear center. The force on the rim and torque about the shear center are given by

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:spk_force_torque}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{f}_s &= T\mathbf{n}\\
\tau_s &= \bs \times ( T\mathbf{n} )
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

When the rim is displaced the initial spoke force may change in both magnitude T and in direction n. Displacements of the rim are assumed to be small enough to linearize Equation \eqref{eq:spk_force_torque} with respect to the displacement and twist angle of the rim cross-section.

The displacement $u_s$ can be decomposed into a component parallel to the spoke axis and a component transverse to the spoke axis. The parallel component leads to a net force in the axial direction $K_s u_{s\parallel}$, where $K_s$ is the axial stiffness of the spoke. The transverse component produces a net restoring force in the transverse direction of $(T/l_s) u_{s\perp}$ due to the rotation of the spoke through an angle $\theta \approx u_{s\perp}/l_s$. This is the same effect (tension stiffness, or membrane stiffness) which gives a tensed string or thin membrane its transverse stiffness. This leads to the linearized form of \eqref{eq:spk_force_torque}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fs_us}
\mathbf{f}_s = T\n +
    K_s (\mathbf{u}_s \cdot \n)\n +
    \left(\frac{T}{l_s}\right) \left((\mathbf{u}_s \cdot \npo ) \npo +
                                     (\mathbf{u}_s \cdot \npt ) \npt \right)
\end{equation}

where $\n,\npo,\npt$ are mutually orthogonal unit vectors. Using the identity that $\n\otimes\n + \npo\otimes\npo + \npt\otimes\npt = \mathbf{I}$, we obtain the spoke force stiffness tensor:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kf}
\mathbf{k}_f = K_s \n\otimes\n + \frac{T}{l_s}(\mathbf{I} - \n\otimes\n)
\end{equation}

The tensor product (or dyadic product) $\n\otimes\n$ of two vectors is conveniently calculated in matrix form by the matrix product $\n\n^T$, where $\n$ is a column vector  and $^T$ denotes the matrix transpose.

The displacement $\mathbf{u}_s$ of the spoke nipple is related to the displacement $\mathbf{u}$ of the shear center and infinitesimal rotation $\phi$ about the shear center by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u_s}
\mathbf{u}_s = \mathbf{u} + \phi\eh \times \bs
\end{equation}

In terms of $\mathbf{u}$, the force exerted by the spokes is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fs_u}
\mathbf{f}_s - \mathbf{f}_{s0} = \mathbf{k}_f \cdot (\mathbf{u} + \phi\eh\times\bs)
\end{equation}

The change in torque due to deflection can be expanded in terms of the change due to the rim displacements $u$ and the change due to the rotation $\phi$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:taus}
\tau_s - \tau_{s0} = \nabla_u\mathbf{\tau}_s\cdot\mathbf{u} +
    \frac{\partial\tau_s}{\partial\phi}
\end{equation}

Since the moment arm $\bs$ does not change due to a rigid body displacement of the entire rim cross-section, the first term in Equation \eqref{eq:taus} is given by the moment arm times the change in spoke force.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:taus_del}
\begin{split}
\nabla_u\tau_s\cdot\mathbf{u} &= \eh\cdot (\bs\times\mathbf{k}_f\cdot\mathbf{u})\\
    &= -[(\eh\times\bs)\cdot\mathbf{k}_f]\cdot\mathbf{u}
\end{split}
\end{align}

Expanding $\partial\tau_s/\partial\phi$ using the product rule results in three parts which represent the change in torque due to (a) the change in spoke tension, (b) the change in the moment arm, and (c) the change in direction of the spoke force.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:taus_part}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial\tau_s}{\partial\phi} &= \eh\cdot \left[
    \left(\bs\times \frac{\partial T}{\partial\phi}\n\right) +
    \left( \frac{\partial\bs}{\partial\phi} \times T_0\n \right) +
    \left( \bs \times T_0 \frac{\partial\n}{\partial\phi} \right) \right]\\
\eh\cdot\left(\bs\times \frac{\partial T}{\partial\phi}\n\right) &=
    \eh\cdot(\bs\times\n)\left(K_s\eh\times\bs\cdot\n\right)\\
    &= K_s(\eh\cdot\bs\times\n)^2\\
\eh\cdot\left( \frac{\partial\bs}{\partial\phi} \times T_0\n \right) &=
    T_0\eh\cdot((\eh\times\bs)\times\n)\\
\eh\cdot\left( \bs \times T_0 \frac{\partial\n}{\partial\phi} \right) &=
    T_0\eh\cdot\left(\bs \times \frac{\eh\times\bs}{l_s} \right)
\end{split}
\end{align}

Combining Equations \eqref{eq:fs_u}, \eqref{eq:taus}, \eqref{eq:taus_del}, and \eqref{eq:taus_part} results in a matrix equation for the change in force and torque due to a single spoke.

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
f_1\\f_2\\f_3\\f_4
\end{bmatrix}
=\mathbf{k}_s
\begin{bmatrix}
u\\v\\w\\\phi
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_s}
\mathbf{k}_s =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{k}                      & \mathbf{k}_f\cdot(\eh\times\bs)\\
(\eh\times\bs)\cdot\mathbf{k}_f & \frac{\partial\tau_s}{\partial\phi}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Note that $\mathbf{k}_f$ is a 3x3 matrix relating the spoke force to the spoke nipple displacement while $\mathbf{k}_s$ is a 4x4 matrix relating the spoke force \emph{and} torque to the rim shear center displacement. The total stiffness $\mathbf{k}_s$ is composed of two terms: the axial elastic stiffness proportional to $K_s$, and the tension stiffness proportional the initial spoke tension in the reference configuration, $T$. The elastic stiffness arises from stretching or shortening of the spoke and the tension stiffness arises from the change in direction of the spoke.

The strain energy in the spoke system is then

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_spokes_discrete}
U_{spokes} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i^{n_s} [\mathbf{u}(s_i), \phi(s_i)]^T \cdot \mathbf{k}_{s,i}\cdot [\mathbf{u}(s_i), \phi(s_i)]
\end{equation}

where $s_i$ is the location of each spoke.

\subsection{Smeared spokes approximation}
Equation \ref{eq:U_spokes_discrete} is not amenable to analytical solutions because it requires evaluation of the displacement field at discrete points. Following the approach of Smith\cite{Smith} and Pippard\cite{Pippard}, we approximate the stiffness of the discrete spokes with a continuous elastic foundation matching the stiffness per unit length along the rim. The continuous analog of Equation \eqref{eq:k_s} is obtained by averaging the components of the spoke stiffness matrices in cylindrical coordinates for the smallest periodic unit of spokes and dividing by the length along the rim:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:k_bar}
\mathbf{\bar{k}} = \frac{1}{2\pi R} \sum_i^{n_s} \mathbf{k}_s
\end{equation}

The change in strain energy in the spoke system from the reference configuration to the deformed configuration is then approximated by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:U_spokes}
U_{spokes} = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2\pi R} \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{\bar{k}} \cdot \mathbf{u} \, ds
\end{equation}

What information is lost in this smeared approach? An actual wheel in which 32 spokes of diameter 2 mm were replaced by 3200 spokes of diameter 0.2 mm will have some differences in behavior.
Most obviously, if a solution based on smeared spokes exhibits length scales comparable to spoke spacing, such solutions would not be expected to be terribly accurate for the realistic wheel. This problem appears most particularly for concentrated radial loads, where the ``affected length'' includes very few spokes. It is far less important for tangential and lateral loads. It is even reduced in importance in the radial case, as most loads are spread by the tire to involve several spokes.

Perhaps the most surprising effect of the actual spaced spokes has to do with the very inhomogeneous support stiffness connected to the rim. Since spokes are not purely radial, an inward motion at the end of one spoke will actually give rise to lateral and tangential reaction forces on the rim. The very next spoke, under a similar deformation, will switch signs of the lateral or tangential reaction. So one result is that a concentrated radial load gives rise to both tangential and lateral load at the same point. Furthermore, whenever a loading gives rise to displacements around the entire wheel, those displacements give rise to period-four sinusoidally varying radial, tangential, and lateral loads. Thus one observes small-scale sinusoidal variations in spoke tension or rim deflection, around the entire wheel. Such behavior is entirely suppressed by the smeared stiffness approach.


\section{Stress and deformation of the pretensioned wheel}

In the absence of external loads, the bicycle rim is loaded radially by the system of spokes, and to a lesser extent by the tire air pressure if the tire casing is not bonded to the rim\cite{Burgoyne}. The rim shrinks due to the compressive hoop stress induced by the pull of the spokes and bows inwards at each spoke due to the bending moment introduced by the spacing between spokes. The average radial tension per unit length exerted by the spokes is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tbar}
\bar{T} = \frac{1}{2\pi R} \sum_i^{n_s} \mathbf{T}_i\cdot\et
\end{equation}

Consider a rim segment containing a single spoke, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:vM_vC} (a). By symmetry, the axial force and moment must be equal at the two ends. Equilibrium of forces in the horizontal direction immediately requires $V=0$. Sum of forces in the vertical direction gives

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Nr}
N_r = \frac{\pi R\bar{T}}{n_s\sin{(\pi/n_s)}} \approx R\bar{T}
\end{equation}

where the second result, first derived by Sharp\cite{Sharp}, is obtained by noting that $\sin{\pi/n_s}\approx \pi/n_s$ for sufficiently large $n_s$. The internal forces at an arbitrary section at $\theta < \pi/n_s$ are obtained from equilibrium of the segment shown in Figure \ref{fig:radial_bulging} (b). The unknown end moment $M$ is determined from the condition that there can be no rotation of the cross-section at the symmetry point between spokes.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:NVM}
N_r' &= R\bar{T}\cos{\theta}\\
V'   &= R\bar{T}\sin{\theta}\\
M'   &= R^2\bar{T} \left( \frac{\sin{\pi/n_s}}{\pi/n_s} - \cos{\theta} \right)
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Castigliano's method can be used to determine the displacement at the spoke due to axial compression alone and bending

\begin{align}
v_C &= \frac{R^2\bar{T}}{2EA} \left( \left(\frac{\pi/n_s}{\sin{\pi/n_s}}\right)^2 +
    \frac{\pi/n_s}{\tan{\pi/n_s}}\right)
    \approx \frac{R^2\bar{T}}{EA}\label{eq:vC}\\
v_M &= \frac{R^4\bar{T}}{2EI} \left( \left(\frac{\pi/n_s}{\sin{\pi/n_s}}\right)^2 +
    \frac{\pi/n_s}{\tan{\pi/n_s}} - 2\right)\label{eq:vM}
\end{align}

The relative contribution of $v_M$ is generally very small compared to $v_C$. To a very close approximation, $v_M/v_C=(1/45)(R/r_y)^2(\pi/n_s)^4$, where $r_y$ is the radius of gyration of the rim in the radial direction. Bending deformations become significant if the number of spokes is very low or the rim bending stiffness is very small in the radial direction. Low spoke-count wheels generally have very deep cross-sections to minimize bending deformation between spokes.


\section{Stresses in the wheel under external loads}

We assume the rim is loaded by distributed forces $f_u,f_v,f_w$ and a distributed moment $m$. The total potential energy in the deformed configuration under this system of loads is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TotPot}
\Pi = U_{rim} + U_{spokes} - (f_uu+f_vv+f_ww+m\phi)
\end{equation}

The solution for the displacements is found by minimizing \eqref{eq:TotPot}. The Euler-Lagrange equations for \eqref{eq:TotPot} give a set of four coupled differential equations for the displacement variables:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EulerLagrange}
\begin{bmatrix}
 \D_{vv} + \bar{k}_{vv} & \D_{vw} + \bar{k}_{vw} & \bar{k}_{uv} & \bar{k}_{v\phi}\\
-\D_{vw} + \bar{k}_{vw} & \D_{ww} + \bar{k}_{ww} & \bar{k}_{uw} & \bar{k}_{w\phi}\\
\bar{k}_{uv}    & \bar{k}_{uw}    & \D_{uu} + \bar{k}_{uu} & \D_{u\phi} + \bar{k}_{u\phi}\\
\bar{k}_{v\phi} & \bar{k}_{w\phi} & \D_{u\phi} + \bar{k}_{u\phi} & \D_{\phi\phi} + \bar{k}_{\phi\phi}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v\\w\\u\\\phi
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
f_v\\f_w\\f_u\\m
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align*}
\D_{vv} &= (EI_1 + EAy_0^2)\D^4 - 2EA\left(\frac{y_0}{R}\right)\D^2 + \frac{EA}{R^2}\\
\D_{ww} &= -\left(\frac{EI_1}{R^2} + EA\left(1+\frac{y_0}{R}\right)^2\right)\D^2\\
\D_{vw} &= \left(\frac{EI_1}{R} + EAy_0\left(1+\frac{y_0}{R}\right)\right)\D^3 - \frac{EA}{R}\left(1+\frac{y_0}{R}\right)\D\\
\D_{uu} &= \left(EA_2 + \frac{EI_w}{R^2}\right)\D^4 - \frac{GJ}{R^2}\D^2\\
\D {u\phi} &= \frac{EI_w}{R}\D^4 - \left(\frac{EI_2}{R} + \frac{GJ}{R}\right)\D^2\\
\D_{\phi\phi} &= EI_w\D^4 - GJ\,\D^2 + \frac{EI_2}{R^2}
\end{align*}

and $\D^n \equiv (d/ds)^n$.

Due to the spoke stiffness parameters $\bar{k}_{ij}$, all of the displacement variables appear in each of the equilibrium equations. In the most general case with no further simplifications or symmetries, the combined governing equation is a 14\textsuperscript{th} order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. In most cases relevant to real wheels many of the coupling terms $\bar{k}_{ij}$ $(i \neq j)$ are identically zero or are small compared to other relevant quantities. For example, in a wheel with either mirror symmetry or mirror-rotational symmetry across the plane of the wheel, all the off-diagonal terms $\bar{k}_{ij}$ $(i \neq j)$ are identically zero, except $\bar{k}_{u\phi}$. In the case where $\bar{k}_{uv}=\bar{k}_{uw}=\bar{k}_{v\phi}=\bar{k}_{w\phi}=0$, the equilibrium equations decouple into a pair of equations for radial-tangential deformations and a pair of equations for lateral-torsional deformations.

\subsection{Loads in the plane of the wheel}

The radial-tangential equations are

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:rad_tan_2}
(EI_1 + EAy_0^2)\left( \ds{v}{4} + \frac{1}{R}\ds{w}{3} \right) -
    \frac{EA}{R}\left( \frac{dw}{ds} - \frac{v}{R} +y_0\left(2\ds{v}{2} + \frac{1}{R}\frac{dw}{ds} -
    R\ds{w}{3}\right) \right) +\bar{k}_{vv}v = f_v\\
-\left( \frac{EA_1}{R} + EAy_0\left( 1 + \frac{y_0}{R} \right) \right)
    \left(\ds{v}{3} + \frac{1}{R}\ds{w}{2} \right) -
    EA\left(1+\frac{y_0}{R} \right) \left(\ds{w}{2} - \frac{1}{R}\frac{dv}{ds} \right) + \bar{k}_{ww}w = f_w
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Combining these two equations (equivalent to taking the determinant of the $v,w$ submatrix in Equation \eqref{eq:rad_tan_2}) results in a single governing equation for $v$:

\begin{multline}
\label{eq:rad_tan_ry}
\dt{v}{6} + \left[2-\lambda_{ww}\left(\left(\frac{y_0}{R}\right)^2 +
                                        \left(\frac{r_y}{R}\right)^2 \right) \right] \dt{v}{4}\\
          + \left[1+\lambda_{vv}\left(\left(1+\frac{y_0}{R}\right)^2+\left(\frac{r_y}{R}\right)^2\right)
                   +2\lambda_{ww}\left(\frac{y_0}{R}\right)\right]\dt{v}{2}
          - \lambda_{ww}\left[1+\lambda_{vv}\left(\frac{r_y}{R}\right)^2\right] v = 0
\end{multline}

where $\lambda_{vv}=\bar{k}_{vv}R^4/EI_1$ and $\lambda_{ww}=\bar{k}_{ww}R^4/EI_1$. The tangential spoke stiffness $\bar{k}_{ww}$ is related to the projection of the spoke stiffness along the tangential direction. For practical wheels, $\bar{k}_{ww}$ is at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than $\bar{k}_{vv}$. Analytical solutions to Equation \eqref{eq:rad_tan_ry} are possible because the roots of the characteristic equation come in three pairs, $\pm r_i$.

Further simplification is possible for most practical cases by noting that $y_0,r_y \ll R$. These conditions are equivalent to assuming that the beam is doubly-symmetric, and that extension of the centerline can be neglected, respectively.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rad_tan}
\dt{v}{6} + 2\dt{v}{4}+(1+\lambda_{vv})\dt{v}{2} - \lambda_{ww}v=0
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:rad_tan} is the same as Pippard’s result obtained from equilibrium of a differential element of the rim24. The boundary conditions and solution procedure is identical for Equations \eqref{eq:rad_tan} and \eqref{eq:rad_tan_ry}.

\subsubsection{Loading case I: radial point load}

\subsubsection{Loading case II: tangential point load}
The reaction force from the road on the wheel may be represented by a radial point load at $\theta=0$. The radial displacement closely resembles the classical solution of a point load acting on a beam supported by an elastic foundation\cite{Hetenyi}. The radial deformation is confined to a narrow arc around the load point in which spokes lose tension, bounded by an ``overshoot'' region where spokes tensions increase and reach a maximum within about 30$^{\circ}$ of the load point. Far from the load, spoke tensions generally change by a very small amount on the order of 5\% of the applied load. This has led some authors to claim that ``the hub stands on the spokes beneath it,'' despite the counter-intuitive image this conjures\cite{Brandt}. Others insist that the hub ``hangs from the spokes above it'' due to the fact that the spoke tensions above the hub are higher than those below it.  Both statements are mathematically equivalent, and it is clear that the lower spokes play the most significant dynamic role in supporting the bicycle and are most prone to loosening or buckling under load.

If, as is generally the case for practical wheels, $\lambda_{ww} \ll \lambda_{ww}$, or more rigorously for the case of purely radial spokes, Equation \eqref{eq:rad_tan} simplifies to

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rad}
\dt{v}{4} + 2\dt{v}{2} + (1+\lambda_{vv})v=0
\end{equation}

Since all the derivatives have even order, a relatively simple analytical solution to \eqref{eq:rad} exists. The most relevant loading case for the bicycle wheel is approximated by a point load $P$ located at $\theta=0$ corresponding to the reaction force from the road. In this case the radial displacement is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rad_soln}
v = \frac{PR^3}{4abEI_1} \left( \frac{2ab}{\pi\eta^2} + \frac{b\sinh{a\theta}\cos{b\theta}}{\eta}

This solution for radial spokes was first given in slightly different form by Smith\cite{Smith} in 1901 and later by Pippard\cite{Pippard} in 1931, who also performed experiments on spoked wheels. The non-dimensionalized radial stiffness depends only on the stiffness ratio $\lambda_{vv}$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Krad}
\frac{K_{rad}}{\pi R \bar{k}_{vv}} =
    \frac{1}{\pi\lambda_{vv}} \left(\frac{1}{2\pi\eta^2}
                                    -\frac{b\sinh{a\pi}\cosh{a\pi} + a\sin{b\pi}\cos{b\pi}}
                                     {4ab\eta (\sinh^2{a\pi} + \sin^2{b\pi})} \right)^{-1}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Loading case II: Tangential point load}

During acceleration (or braking using disc brakes), the reaction force from the road has a component in the tangential direction. The tangential displacement is primarily controlled by the stiffness $\bar{k}_{ww}$, while the ratio $\lambda_{ww}/\lambda_{vv}$ controls the degree to which radial displacement is also involved.

A very satisfactory approximation to the problem of a tangential load can be obtained by noting that $\lambda_{vv}\gg\lambda_{ww}$ and therefore the radial displacement is very small compared with the tangential displacement. Under this approximation, the rim rotates about the axle as a rigid body and the tangential stiffness is simply

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ktan}
K_{tan} = 2\pi R \bar{k}_{ww}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{The role of spoke tension in supporting radial and tangential loads}

The model considered here depends on the assumption that a pretensioned spoke can equally support tension or compression (or rather, loss of tension) and that the elastic properties remain constant. In order for this assumption to be valid, all of the spokes must maintain a non-zero tension at all times. This condition may be violated if an excessive load is applied to the wheel.

Figure \ref{fig:} shows the change in spoke tension under different loading scenarios. In this example, the most critical spoke supports 40\% of the applied load, while the load sharing fractions for the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor spokes are about 24\% and 3\%, respectively. A properly tensioned wheel should not admit spokes go slack under typical loads.

On a typical wheel with ``cross'' laced spokes, half of the spokes are inclined forward in the plane of the wheel, while the other half are inclined backwards. These are referred to as ``pushing'' and ``pulling'' or ``leading'' and ``trailing'' spokes due to their behavior under load. Pulling spokes increase their tension under acceleration torque while pushing spokes decrease their tension, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:} (b). Under a combined radial load and acceleration torque, the primary factor causing spokes to slacken is the radial load, while the primary factor causing spokes to tighten is the tangential load. Therefore, both types of loads should be accounted for when making fatigue calculations.
