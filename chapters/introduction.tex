The modern bicycle wheel has changed little in form and function since the 1870's. With its elegant system of slender spokes, the wheel is the most recognizable feature of the bicycle--an invention whose success it critically enabled. Indeed, the term ``wheel'' was once used to refer to the entire bicycle; the League of American Bicyclists was once the League of American Wheelmen before changing their name in 1994.
