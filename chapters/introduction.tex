% The bicycle will celebrate its 200\textsuperscript{th} anniversary in 2018 if we define a bicycle as a steerable, two-wheeled, human-powered contraption.

In its heyday in the 1890's, the bicycle was regarded as one of the most advanced products of the Industrial Age. Inventors and industrialists spent considerable effort mastering the manufacture of lighter, more efficient machines. Many ubiquitous technologies made their debut on or were perfected for the bicycle including ball-bearings, chain drives, and tensioned wheels. Although most people know that the Wright brothers were bicycle mechanics, it is less commonly known that Henry Ford and Horace Dodge \cite{}, fathers of their eponymous automobile empires, got their start in the bicycle industry. Although these may be regarded as humble beginnings to a modern observer, at the time the bicycle was considered high technology.

The bicycle subsequently ceded this title to the auto industry, the aerospace industry, and finally to the digital electronics and nanotechnology industries. Bicycle technology has not radically changed since the introduction of derailleur gears in the 1920’s. There is no longer a crowd of technical minds bent on the perfection of ``the mechanical horse,'' but this should be seen as the inevitable maturation of a truly civilized technology. The bicycle is humanity's most efficient means of transportation---a technology for the age of climate change---and will be a key component of the modern, sustainable city.

Bicycles have not become significantly more complex over time, which has enabled widespread participation in bicycle design and maintenance by amateurs. A few industry standards dominate each major component, allowing parts to be easily swapped, upgraded, or modified. Most cities have bicycle co-ops where community members can collaborate, share tools and learn about bicycle repair. A classic example of “user innovation” was the invention of the mountain bike in California by a loose group of cycling enthusiasts. Using older steel-frame bicycles (mostly used Schwinns from the 1950’s), these pioneers hacked together rugged bikes to meet the demands of off-road cycling. Eventually, the industry picked up the trend and mountain bicycles constitute the majority of bicycles sold in America today\cite{NoHands}.


\section{History of the bicycle wheel}
With its elegant system of slender spokes, the wheel is the most recognizable feature of the bicycle---an invention whose success it critically enabled. Indeed, the term ``wheel'' was once used to refer to the entire bicycle; the League of American Bicyclists was once the League of American Wheelmen before changing their name in 1994.

The vast majority of bicycle wheels produced today are pretensioned ``wire-spoked'' wheels in which a slender system of pre-tensioned spokes resist buckling when loaded. Originally conceived for aircraft landing gear by Sir George Cayley in 1808, the prestressed wire-spoked wheel saw its first practical application on the bicycle and the design was later utilized in early automobiles and aircraft\cite{HadlandLessing}. Although materials and manufacturing methods have evolved over time, the fundamental design, a system of individually prestressed spokes in tension stabilized by a rim in compression, has not significantly changed since the 1870's.

For the first 50 years of the bicycle, wheels generally consisted of a small number of stout wooden spokes fitted into individual wooden rim sections, known as felloes, fitted together with mortice and tenon joints. An iron tire was heated and placed around the circumference of the rim and allowed to cool and contract, putting the spokes in compression and the tire in tension\cite{Sharp}. The structure was held together by this prestress; there was no need to bond the rim sections together. The spokes, necessarily large to resist buckling, made these wheels extremely heavy. Eugene Meyer obtained a patent for a tensioned wire-spoked wheel in 1869, which enabled the construction of much larger wheels\cite{Clayton}. In the tension-spoke wheel the method of prestress was reversed. Each slender iron spoke could be individually pre-tensioned, stabilized by an iron rim in compression.

Several other prestressing methods were developed around the same time. W. F. Reynolds and J. A. Mays introduced the Phantom bicycle featuring looped wire spokes secured to one flange of the hub, laced through an eyelet on the rim, and secured to the other hub flange\cite{Herlihy}. The spokes were all tensioned simultaneously by spreading apart the hub flanges. The spokes of James Starley's successful Ariel bicycle, which emerged radially from the hub, were pre-stressed simultaneously by rotating the hub relative to the rim by means of a pair of levers connected to the hub and secured to the rim by adjustable tensioning rods\cite{Caunter}. Although the spokes were attached radially (and therefore could not transmit appreciable torque), the prestress resulted in a small offset which conferred rotational stiffness. The tangent-spoked wheel, developed by Starley in 1874, achieved rotational stiffness by connecting the spokes tangent to the hub. This design has survived, in large part, up until the present day.

Prestressing of the spokes allowed the use of thin wire, rather than stout wooden spokes, enabling larger and lighter wheels. The gear of a direct-drive pedal-driven bicycle (the linear distance traveled per rotation of the cranks) is simply equal to the circumference of the wheel, so a larger wheel confers a considerable speed advantage. The high-wheel bicycle enjoyed popularity amongst primarily young men of means thoughout the 1880's and into the 1890's \cite{SocialHistory}. The development of practical and lightweight chain drives brought the ``safety bicycle'' to the masses---so named because the gear ratio afforded by the chain enabled the use of a smaller front wheel, reducing the risk of pitching over the handlebars.

\section{The Eiffel Tower and the Ferris Wheel}

The arrival of the tensioned bicycle wheel came during a time of rapid progress in the use of iron and steel in lightweight structures. The Home Insurance Building in Chicago, completed in 1885, was built around a steel skeleton-frame \cite{something}. The Eiffel Tower, constructed in 1889 for the World's Fair, became the tallest human-built structure in the world. Its sparse, wrought-iron truss frame impressed visitors and initially drew sharp criticism from the engineering community\cite{something}. The first prestressed bicycle wheels were commonly called ``suspension wheels,'' perhaps due to an analogy with the suspension bridge, itself a relatively new structural innovation\cite{SciAm}.

Perhaps the most striking structural analogy to the bicycle wheel, the Ferris Wheel, was completed in 1893 for the Columbian World Exposition in Chicago\cite{something}. Crafted as Chicago's answer to the Eiffel tower, George Washington Gale Ferris' wheel drew frequent comparisons to the bicycle, such as the following observation by Julian Hawthorne, (son of the novelist, Nathaniel) \cite{Wiki:FerrisWheel}:

\begin{quote}
\emph{``...it has no visible means of support---none that appear adequate. The spokes look like cobwebs; they are after the fashion of those on the newest make of bicycles.''}
\end{quote}

Of course the means of support were adequate, and the ``Chicago Wheel'' derived its remarkable stability from the fact that the iron spokes were pretensioned by turnbuckles so as not to lose tension (and therefore stiffness) when they came to be at the top of the wheel. The construction of the Ferris Wheel, and perhaps the reluctance of its builders to satisfy the engineering community with details of its analysis \cite{AmericanRailwayJournal}, spurred considerable interest and debate \cite{AmericanRailwayJournal2,Searles}. These early analyses relied heavily on intuition or assumued that the rim was stiff enough that all deformation was confined to the spokes. But the technical marvel of the Ferris Wheel, and the bicycle wheel that preceded it, may have inspired a long but sparse effort to understand the mechanics of pretensioned wheels.

In his 1896 Treatise on the mechanics and design of bicycles and tricycles \cite{Sharp}, Archibald Sharp gave a brief, qualitative treatment on the deformation of a tension-spoked wheel. He correctly noted that the bottom spokes play the most dynamic role in supporting loads applied to the hub. The then motivated the development of a set of equations for the tensions in the spokes using a polygonal approximation for the rim and correctly deduced that they form a statically indeterminant system.

\subsection{Analytical studies}

In 1901, Bernard Smith \cite{Smith} analyzed the deformation of a pretensioned wheel with purely radial spokes analytically by assuming that the number of spokes is great enough such that the spoke tension is continuously distributed about the rim and everywhere proportional to radial displacement. This clever method transforms a discrete system of coupled equations for the spoke tensions into a linear, ordinary differential equation for the radial displacement of the rim. Through an analytical solution, he came to the same conclusion as Sharp---namely, that the bottom spokes play the most direct role in supporting loads---and gave a table for the influence function (change in spoke tensions per unit applied radial load) for a typical 32-spoke wheel.\todo{include diagram from Sharp?}

The most complete theoretical treatment of the deformations of tension-spoked wheels came in a series of investigations in 1931-32 by Alfred J. Sutton Pippard and various coauthors. Pippard, a civil engineer with expertise in elasticity of lightweight structures, was engaged by the British Royal Air Force to undertake an investigation of lightweight wheels for aircraft\footnote{After his retirement in 1956, Pippard took up a yearlong visiting lecturer position at Northwestern University where he taught undergraduate and graduate courses in theory of structures.}. Pippard and Francis derived a set of coupled equations for the spoke tensions in radially-spoked wheels under radial loads, and gave tables for the calculation of wheels with up to six spokes \cite{PippardRad}. Apparently unaware of Smith's earlier contribution, they also gave a general analytical solution for the problem under the smeared-spokes approximation. Recognizing the power of this approach, Pippard and White extended the method to analysis of wheels with non-radial spokes \cite{PippardRadTan}. Pippard and Francis analyzed the wheel under lateral loads \cite{PippardLat}, although they neglected the effects of spoke tension both in the effective lateral stiffness of the spokes and in the mechanics of the rim (which is under compression).

For the purposes of validation, Pippard and Francis performed radial extension tests on specially-constructed wheels with pin-jointed radial spokes to compare the change in spoke tension to the smeared-spokes model. They achieved good agreement in the spoke tension at the loaded point (maximum difference less than 9\%) between theory and experiments, and noted that accuracy increased with the number of spokes, as is expected when assuming that the spoke stiffness is continuously distributed. The rims used in their experiments, cut from solid steel plate, were quite stiff in bending compared to the axial stiffness of the spokes which increases the accuracy of the smeared-spokes model.

% Hetenyi
The Smith-Pippard approximation---taking the limit in which the number of spokes goes to infinity---transforms the bicycle wheel into a curved beam resting on an elastic foundation. The foundation produces a reaction at each point proportional to the local deflection of the beam. The stiffness of the beam effectively spreads out point loads with a characteristic decay length equal to $(4EI/k)^{1/4}$, where $EI$ is the bending stiffness of the beam around the relevant axis and $k$ is the stiffness constant of the foundation (in units of force per unit length, per unit deflection). The theory of beams on elastic foundations was broadly summarized and formalized by Hetenyi \cite{Hetenyi} in his 1946 monograph. He included a treatment of radial deflection of rings on elastic foundations, citing Pippard et. al., but not Smith.

\section{Modern bicycle wheel literature}

After Pippard there has been scarce development of broadly applicable analytical theories for stress analysis of bicycle wheels, to the best of my knowledge. Instead, modern studies have employed finite-element analysis and experimental techniques.

% Brandt
Jobst Brandt, an engineer and cycling enthusiast, published \emph{The Bicycle Wheel} in 1981 as a practical manual for wheelbuilding and brief treatise on wheel mechanics drawn from his own experience and analysis \cite{Brandt}. To illustrate some key points of wheel mechanics, Brandt calculated radial and tangential deformations on a 2-dimensional model of a typical wheel using the finite-element method. Once again the dominant role of the lower spokes is apparent. Finite-element results also exhibit a phenomenon supressed by the continuum approximation of Pippard and Smith: a drive torque applied to the hub and reacted at the road contact point produces a small, periodic, radial distortion of the wheel with a period of four spokes. This effect is due to the local increase and decrease in tensions from leading and trailing spokes in a tangent-spoked wheel. The same periodic deformation would be observed in the lateral deflection, which was neglected in Brandt's 2-dimensional analysis.

% More finite-element
Salamon and Oldham published the first comparative finite-element study of the bicycle wheel. They compared wheels with radial spokes to wheels with tangent spokes under purely radial loading, finding that the radially-spoked wheel was only 5\% stiffer than the tangent-spoked wheel, and the maximum stresses were substantially similar. They also analyzed compression-spoke wheels with 3, 7, and 9 spokes and found that the bending stress varied by up to an order of magnitude when the load was moved from directly under a spoke to a point halfway between spokes.

Most experimental and theoretical studies have neglected the effect of the tire and inner tube due to the considerable complexity introduced. Burgoyne and Dilmaghanian \cite{Burgoyne} studied the entire spokes-rim-tire-tube assembly as an engineering system and demonstrated that the tire effectively spreads out radial loads along a segment of rim near the contact point. The load distribution has a significant effect on the bending moment sustained by the rim (hence the danger of damaging the rim when hitting a pothole at low inflation pressure), but only has a small effect on spoke strain. They identified three important prestessing systems in the wheel: (1) the spokes prestressed against the rim, (2) the tire casing prestressed by the air pressure, and (3) the prestressing of the tire bead against the tension in the sidewalls\todo{They actually talk about the bead being prestressed against the rim due to its shorter circumference, but I think this is incorrect.}.

% Gavin and spoke fatigue

The rim and spokes are structurally coupled and their contributions to wheel stiffness cannot be easily decoupled. In an attempt to separately quantify the contributions of the spokes and rim, Minguez and Vogwell \cite{MinguezVogwell} derived a model for the radial stiffness of bicycle wheels by assuming that the top half of the rim remains perfectly rigid, and the bottom half deforms from a circular arc to an ellipsoidal (squashed) arc. They calculated the stiffness using Castigliano's theorem on the assumed displacement field. This assumption contradicts the qualitative observations by Sharp and calculations by Smith for typical wheels (that the distortion of the rim is limited to a narrow arc about the bottom spoke), but they nevertheless achieved close (within 10\%) agreement due to their choice of very stiff rims on wheels with few ($<18$) spokes.

The structural simplicity of the bicycle wheel makes finite-element analysis straightforward: the spokes and rim can be readily modeled with structural beam elements, and no delicate choices must be made regarding meshing, except to choose an appropriate discretization for the curvature of the rim. Due to its structural simplicity, and broad appeal, the bicycle wheel is a popular subject for undergraduate and hobbyist projects, and masters theses. These authors have focused on stiffness and stress analysis \cite{Ng,Hartz}, optimization \cite{Keller,Svensson}, and buckling \cite{Kern}.
